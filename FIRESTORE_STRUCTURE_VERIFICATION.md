# ✅ Firestore Structure Verification

## 🔍 Question: Does entity_id get included in Firestore documents?

**Answer: YES ✅** - The entity_id is included inside every transaction document uploaded to Firestore.

---

## 📊 Complete Data Flow

### **1. Transaction Creation** (Line 2957-2964)
```python
transaction = {
    "name": name,
    "card": str(card_int),
    "reader": reader_id,
    "status": status,
    "timestamp": timestamp,
    "entity_id": ENTITY_ID  # ✅ INCLUDED HERE
}
```

**Result:** Transaction object is created with `entity_id` field.

---

### **2. Upload to Firestore** (Line 2997-2998)
```python
# Remove ONLY the sync flag (internal tracking)
upload_data = {k: v for k, v in transaction.items() if k != "synced_to_firestore"}

# Upload to Firestore (entity_id is preserved)
db.collection("transactions").add(upload_data)
```

**What gets filtered out:** Only `synced_to_firestore` (internal flag)
**What gets uploaded:** Everything else INCLUDING `entity_id`

**Upload Data:**
```python
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "card": "1234567890",
    "reader": 1,
    "status": "Access Granted",
    "timestamp": 1697472000,
    "entity_id": "site_a"  # ✅ INCLUDED IN UPLOAD
}
# synced_to_firestore is NOT uploaded (internal only)
```

---

### **3. Firestore Structure** (Flat with entity_id)
```
Firestore Database:
└── transactions/
    ├── {auto-push-id-1}/
    │   ├── name: "John Doe"
    │   ├── card: "1234567890"
    │   ├── reader: 1
    │   ├── status: "Access Granted"
    │   ├── timestamp: 1697472000
    │   └── entity_id: "site_a"  ← ✅ INCLUDED
    │
    ├── {auto-push-id-2}/
    │   ├── name: "Jane Smith"
    │   ├── card: "0987654321"
    │   ├── reader: 2
    │   ├── status: "Access Denied"
    │   ├── timestamp: 1697472060
    │   └── entity_id: "site_a"  ← ✅ INCLUDED
    │
    └── {auto-push-id-3}/
        ├── name: "Bob Wilson"
        ├── card: "1122334455"
        ├── reader: 1
        ├── status: "Access Granted"
        ├── timestamp: 1697472120
        └── entity_id: "site_b"  ← ✅ DIFFERENT ENTITY
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### **Step 1: Check Transaction Creation**
```python
# File: integrated_access_camera.py
# Line: 2957-2964

transaction = {
    "name": name,
    "card": str(card_int),
    "reader": reader_id,
    "status": status,
    "timestamp": timestamp,
    "entity_id": ENTITY_ID  # ✅ Present
}
```
**Status:** ✅ entity_id is in the transaction object

---

### **Step 2: Check Upload Filter**
```python
# File: integrated_access_camera.py
# Line: 2997

upload_data = {k: v for k, v in transaction.items() if k != "synced_to_firestore"}
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a copy of transaction dictionary
- Filters out ONLY the key `"synced_to_firestore"`
- Keeps everything else, INCLUDING `"entity_id"`

**Status:** ✅ entity_id is NOT filtered out

---

### **Step 3: Check Firestore Upload**
```python
# File: integrated_access_camera.py
# Line: 2998

db.collection("transactions").add(upload_data)
```

**What gets uploaded:**
```json
{
  "name": "...",
  "card": "...",
  "reader": 1,
  "status": "...",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "entity_id": "site_a"  ✅
}
```

**Status:** ✅ entity_id is uploaded to Firestore

---

## 📋 Local Cache vs Firestore

### **Local Cache (transactions_cache.json)**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "card": "1234567890",
    "reader": 1,
    "status": "Access Granted",
    "timestamp": 1697472000,
    "entity_id": "site_a",
    "synced_to_firestore": true  ← Internal flag (local only)
  }
]
```

### **Firestore (transactions collection)**
```
transactions/{auto-id}/
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "card": "1234567890",
  "reader": 1,
  "status": "Access Granted",
  "timestamp": 1697472000,
  "entity_id": "site_a"
  // NO synced_to_firestore flag (filtered out)
}
```

**Key Difference:**
- `synced_to_firestore` is ONLY in local cache (for tracking)
- `entity_id` is in BOTH local cache AND Firestore

---

## 🔄 Sync Process Verification

### **sync_transactions() Function** (Line 460)
```python
# Remove sync flag before uploading (internal use only)
upload_data = {k: v for k, v in txn.items() if k != "synced_to_firestore"}

# Upload to Firestore (flat structure with entity_id)
db.collection("transactions").add(upload_data)
```

**Same logic:**
- Filters out `synced_to_firestore`
- Keeps `entity_id`

**Status:** ✅ entity_id is uploaded during sync too

---

## 🎯 Multi-Tenant Support

### **How Queries Work**
```python
# When querying transactions for a specific entity:
db.collection("transactions") \
  .where(filter=FieldFilter("entity_id", "==", "site_a")) \
  .order_by("timestamp", direction=firestore.Query.DESCENDING) \
  .limit(10).stream()
```

**This works because:**
- Every transaction HAS `entity_id` field
- Firestore can filter by `entity_id`
- Each entity sees only their transactions

---

## ✅ Final Verification Checklist

- [x] **Upload filter preserves entity_id** (Line 2997)
- [x] **Only synced_to_firestore filtered out** (Line 2997)
- [x] **Firestore upload includes entity_id** (Line 2998)
- [x] **Sync process preserves entity_id** (Line 460)
- [x] **Queries filter by entity_id** (Multiple locations)

## 🎉 CONFIRMED

### **Yes, entity_id IS included in Firestore documents!** ✅

**Structure:**
```
transactions/
  └── {auto-push-id}/
      ├── name
      ├── card
      ├── reader
      ├── status
      ├── timestamp
      └── entity_id  ← ✅ ALWAYS INCLUDED
```

**Fields Uploaded:**
- ✅ name
- ✅ card
- ✅ reader
- ✅ status
- ✅ timestamp
- ✅ entity_id
- ❌ synced_to_firestore (internal flag, NOT uploaded)

**Multi-Tenant Support:** ✅ Fully functional
- Each transaction has entity_id
- Queries filter by entity_id
- Multiple entities can share same Firestore

**Your Firestore structure is correct and ready for production!** 🚀
